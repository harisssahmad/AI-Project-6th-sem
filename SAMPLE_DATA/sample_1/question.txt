array corresponds to a different batsman, and each column represents an inning played by that
batsman. The values in the array represent the runs scored by each batsman in each inning.
Write a C program to perform the following tasks:
1) Input the number of batsmen and the number of innings from the user.
2) Input the batting performance for each batsman in each inning.
3) Calculate and display the following statistics for each batsman.

● Average runs per inning

● Highest score in a single inning
● Number of centuries (innings with a score of 100 or more)
● Number of half-centuries (innings with a score of 50-99)
Your program should display the statistics for each batsman individually.
